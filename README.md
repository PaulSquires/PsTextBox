# CTextBox

A textbox control for FreeBASIC Win32 applications: a themeable frame of your own colours —
border, rounded corners, outer fill — wrapped around a real RichEdit50W editor that does the
typing, the selection, the clipboard and the undo.

It is the control you reach for when a plain `EDIT` gets you the behaviour but not the look. The
frame is drawn by the control, so nothing about it depends on the visual style the user happens
to be running, and every colour it paints is one you set. Inside the frame you get a cue banner
with its own colour and font, vertically centred text on a single-line control, optional
numeric-only input with a decimal-place limit, and a right-click menu that is itself an
owner-drawn `CPopupMenu` you can theme to match the rest of your application.

Single-line by default. Pass `true` at creation for a multiline control: word wrap, ENTER
inserts a newline, TAB inserts a tab character, and the wheel scrolls. A multiline control never
shows a native scrollbar — it exposes its scroll state in **lines** instead, shaped to be wired
straight to an external scrollbar.

## Requirements

**Files to copy into your project:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox.bi` | Declarations — types, callbacks, constants, function prototypes |
| `CTextBox.inc` | Implementation |
| `CPopupMenu.bi` | The owner-drawn floating menu used for the built-in right-click menu |
| `CPopupMenu.inc` | Its implementation |
| `CBufferPaint.bi` | The flicker-free drawing surface the frame is painted through |
| `CBufferPaint.inc` | Its implementation |

**AfxNova is required.** The control is built on `CWindow`, uses `AfxNova\AfxRichEdit.inc` for
the `RichEdit_*` helpers and `AfxNova\AfxWin.inc` for clipboard access, and `CBufferPaint` draws
through `AfxNova\CGdiPlus.inc`. Sources include AfxNova relative to the workspace root
(`#include once "AfxNova\CWindow.inc"`), so builds need the workspace root on the include path:

```bash
fbc64.exe -i "C:\dev" main.bas
```

**Include order.** `CTextBox.bi` pulls in `CBufferPaint.bi` and `CPopupMenu.bi` itself, but the
three implementation files must be included in dependency order:

```freebasic
#include once "CBufferPaint.inc"
#include once "CPopupMenu.inc"    ' CTextBox's built-in right-click menu runs on it
#include once "CTextBox.inc"
```

**GDI+ must be running before the first repaint and must outlive the last one.** The frame is
rendered through GDI+, so bracket your message loop:

```freebasic
dim as ULONG_PTR gdipToken = AfxGdipInit()
' ... create windows, run the message loop ...
AfxGdipShutdown( gdipToken )
```

`AfxGdipShutdown` must come after every window is destroyed, because each repaint builds and
tears down a `CBufferPaint`. If you also call `CoInitialize`, shut GDI+ down before
`CoUninitialize` — GDI+ leans on COM.

**Never name an identifier `ok`.** GDI+ defines `Ok = 0` as a `Status` enum value in namespace
`AfxNova`, and hosts customarily say `using AfxNova`. An existing variable, parameter or
function called `ok` becomes a duplicate definition the moment you adopt these files. Use `bOK`
instead.

**`CTextBox_FilterMessage` in your message pump is mandatory.** The right-click menu is a
`CPopupMenu`, which is not modal: its keyboard navigation and its dismissal on an outside click
both live in that filter. Skip the call and the menu still opens and still paints, but it cannot
be driven with the arrow keys or Enter, and it never closes when the user clicks elsewhere.

```freebasic
dim uMsg as MSG
do while GetMessage( @uMsg, null, 0, 0 )
    if uMsg.message = WM_QUIT then exit do
    if CTextBox_FilterMessage( @uMsg ) then continue do
    TranslateMessage @uMsg
    DispatchMessage @uMsg
loop
```

One call serves every CTextBox in the application: only one menu chain can be open at a time and
the filter finds it. An application that also hosts a `CMenuBar` calls that filter too; the two
are independent and each stands down while the other's menu is up.

**Tab navigation works without `IsDialogMessage`.** The control's container carries
`WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT` and the RichEdit child inside it carries `WS_TABSTOP`, so the dialog
manager can see through the container to the tabstop — but you do not need the dialog manager
for the common case, because a single-line control handles `VK_TAB` itself (`GetNextDlgTabItem`
against the top-level ancestor, Shift+Tab for the previous stop).

If you do add `IsDialogMessage`, know what it costs you here: it claims `VK_RETURN` and
`VK_ESCAPE` before the control sees them, which defeats the `EnterPressedCallback` and any ESC
handling you have put in the message callback. The bundled demo deliberately runs without it.

A **multiline** control inserts a tab character on TAB and never moves focus. If Tab must leave
a multiline box, veto `WM_KEYDOWN` / `VK_TAB` in the message callback and move focus yourself.

---

## Quick start

```freebasic
' Create it. The control is created zero-sized and hidden.
dim as HWND hCtl = CTextBox_Create( hWndParent, IDC_MYFORM_SEARCH )

' Fonts are yours: the control never creates or deletes an HFONT.
CTextBox_SetFont( hCtl, ghFont(GUIFONT_10) )
CTextBox_SetForeColor( hCtl, theme.ForeColor )
CTextBox_SetBackColor( hCtl, theme.BackColorBox )

' Cue banner, shown whenever the buffer is empty. Its colour and font are its own.
CTextBox_SetCueBannerText( hCtl, "Search anything..." )
CTextBox_SetCueBannerColor( hCtl, theme.ForeColorCue )
CTextBox_SetCueBannerFont( hCtl, ghFont(CUEFONT_10) )

' Frame. Every pixel value is a raw device pixel: DPI-scale at the call site.
CTextBox_SetBorderColor( hCtl, theme.BorderColor )
CTextBox_SetFocusBorderColor( hCtl, theme.FocusAccent )
CTextBox_SetCornerRadius( hCtl, pWindow->ScaleX(4) )
CTextBox_SetOuterBackColor( hCtl, theme.BackColorWindow )   ' corners blend into the form
CTextBox_SetMargins( hCtl, pWindow->ScaleX(8), pWindow->ScaleX(8) )

' Events.
CTextBox_SetChangeCallback( hCtl, @TextBox_ChangeCallback )
CTextBox_SetEnterPressedCallback( hCtl, @TextBox_EnterPressedCallback )

' Place it. SWP_SHOWWINDOW is required -- the control is created hidden.
SetWindowPos( hCtl, 0, x, y, nWidth, nHeight, SWP_NOZORDER or SWP_SHOWWINDOW )
```

And the callbacks:

```freebasic
sub TextBox_ChangeCallback( byval hTextBox as HWND )
    ' USER edits only -- typing, cut, paste, undo. CTextBox_SetText never lands here.
    gFilter = CTextBox_GetText( hTextBox )
end sub

sub TextBox_EnterPressedCallback( byval hTextBox as HWND )
    ' Single-line only. The keypress itself is always swallowed: no newline, no beep.
    RunSearch( CTextBox_GetText( hTextBox ) )
end sub
```

Plus the mandatory `CTextBox_FilterMessage` line in the message pump, shown above.

That is the whole minimum. Everything below is refinement.

## Concepts

### The handle is a real HWND

`CTextBox_Create` returns an ordinary window handle, and every `CTextBox_*` function takes it. It
is not an opaque type, so you can treat the control as the window it is — `SetWindowPos` to place
and size it, `ShowWindow` to show it, `GetDlgItem` to find it by the `CtrlID` you passed at
creation.

### There is a real editor inside

The control is a container window that owns the chrome and the geometry, plus a subclassed
`RichEdit50W` child that does all the editing. RichEdit rather than `EDIT` because it supports
vertical centring of the text (`EM_SETRECT`) and per-control colours (`EM_SETCHARFORMAT`,
`EM_SETBKGNDCOLOR`) without owner-draw.

Two consequences you will meet immediately:

- **`GetFocus() = hTextBox` is always false.** Focus sits on the child. Use `CTextBox_HasFocus`.
  Calling `SetFocus` on the container, or sending it `WM_SETFOCUS`, redirects focus to the child
  for you.
- **The child's geometry is derived, never assigned.** Its rect is the container's client rect
  inset by the border width on all four sides. Resizing the control, or changing the border
  width, recomputes it and re-applies the vertical centring and the margins.

`CTextBox_GetRichEditHandle` is the escape hatch for RichEdit-specific messages the flat API and
the message door below do not cover.

### The message door

Sending a classic edit-control message to the **control** works as if it were the edit control
itself. The container forwards:

| Sent to the control | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `EM_GETSEL` … `EM_GETIMESTATUS` | Forwarded verbatim to the RichEdit |
| `WM_GETTEXT`, `WM_GETTEXTLENGTH`, `WM_CUT`, `WM_COPY`, `WM_PASTE`, `WM_CLEAR`, `WM_UNDO` | Forwarded verbatim |
| `WM_SETTEXT`, `EM_REPLACESEL` | Forwarded, and treated as programmatic — **no change callback fires** |
| `EM_SETMARGINS` | Intercepted, so the values are stored and survive later geometry and font changes |
| `WM_SETFONT` | Runs `CTextBox_SetFont` |
| `WM_GETFONT` | Returns the stored text font |

Same operation, two doors: the message for a separate control or window, the function for an
in-process host.

```freebasic
dim as long n = SendMessage( hCtl, WM_GETTEXTLENGTH, 0, 0 )
SendMessage( hCtl, EM_SETSEL, 0, 9 )
```

### It is created zero-sized and hidden

`CTextBox_Create` gives the container the styles `WS_CHILD`, `WS_CLIPSIBLINGS` and
`WS_CLIPCHILDREN`, with `WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT` as its extended style. `WS_VISIBLE` is deliberately
absent, so a newly created control shows nothing until you size it. Include `SWP_SHOWWINDOW` in
your `SetWindowPos` — and note that the RichEdit child is shown by the first resize, so a control
that is never sized never displays its editor at all.

### Single-line and multiline are different controls

The choice is made at `CTextBox_Create` and is fixed for the control's lifetime — `ES_MULTILINE`
cannot be toggled on a live window. What changes:

| | Single-line | Multiline |
|---|---|---|
| Text layout | One line, vertically centred in the frame | Word-wrapped from the top, no vertical centring |
| ENTER | Swallowed; fires `EnterPressedCallback` | Inserts a newline; the callback never fires |
| TAB | Moves focus to the next / previous tabstop | Inserts a tab character |
| Horizontal scroll | `ES_AUTOHSCROLL` | None — the text wraps instead |
| Vertical scroll | n/a | Wheel, keys and caret; no native scrollbar |
| Numeric mode | Available | **Refused** — `CTextBox_SetNumericMode` is a no-op |
| Cue banner | One line, unclipped, on the centred baseline | Word-wrapped at the top left, clipped to the text rect |

### Pixels, and who scales them

**Every pixel value passed to this API is a raw device pixel.** Margins, border width and corner
radius are all taken verbatim; the control never scales a caller's value. DPI-scale at the call
site, typically `pWindow->ScaleX(...)` / `ScaleY(...)`.

That is not an oversight: margins go straight into `EM_SETMARGINS`, so a control-side scale would
both lie to anything reading `EM_GETMARGINS` and double-scale a host that had already scaled.

### One format for the whole buffer

The editor runs in `TM_PLAINTEXT` mode. That is what gives you one character format across the
entire buffer — the control never colours individual characters — and what makes pasted text shed
any rich formatting it arrived with.

`CTextBox_SetFont` and `CTextBox_SetForeColor` are converted together into a single
`CHARFORMATW` (face, size, charset, bold, italic, underline, strikeout, colour) and applied to
the whole buffer with `SCF_ALL`. There is no way to format a run of characters differently, and
that is by design.

`TM_PLAINTEXT` is also the reason `CTextBox_SetTextAlign` is more expensive than it looks — see
that function, and **Behaviour and limits**.

### Programmatic changes are silent

`CTextBox_SetText`, `CTextBox_ReplaceSel`, `CTextBox_Clear`, `CTextBox_SetValue`, the numeric
reformat the control performs on focus loss, and a `WM_SETTEXT` or `EM_REPLACESEL` sent through
the message door all leave the change callback alone. It reports **user** interaction — typing,
cut, paste, undo — and nothing else, which means you can call a setter from inside your own
change handler without recursing.

The scroll-changed callback is the deliberate exception; see **Callbacks**.

### The cue banner

Drawn by the control whenever the buffer is empty, focused or not — the caret blinks over it. It
is painted at the editor's formatting rect, so it sits exactly where typed text will appear,
including the vertical centring on a single-line control. Its colour is independent of the text
forecolor, and its font falls back to the text font when you do not set one.

### The frame

The container paints the outer fill across its whole client area first, then the rounded frame on
top of it. The pixels outside the corner arcs keep showing the outer fill — pass your form's
background colour to `CTextBox_SetOuterBackColor` and rounded corners blend into it instead of
showing white.

The border colour switches to the focus border colour while the editor has focus. A border width
of 0 draws no border at all, and the child then fills the entire client area.

### Lifetime

The control frees itself when its window is destroyed, including the `CPopupMenu` window behind
the right-click menu — that is a `WS_POPUP` window, not a child, so it would not go with the
window tree otherwise. It owns no host resources: every `HFONT` you hand it stays yours to
delete. Destroy the parent and you are done.

---

## Behaviour and limits

Firm properties of the control, not settings:

- **`CTextBox_SetTextAlign` discards the undo history on a control that already has content.**
  Set it at setup time, before anything has been typed. `TM_PLAINTEXT` refuses `EM_SETPARAFORMAT`
  outright and *silently*, so the only sequence the editor accepts is: save the text, empty the
  buffer, switch to `TM_RICHTEXT`, apply the format, switch back, restore the text — and then
  empty the undo buffer, because the undo stack now spans a rewrite the user never made. On an
  empty control that costs nothing and nobody notices.
- **The `CTextBox_FilterMessage` pump call is not optional.** Without it the right-click menu has
  no keyboard navigation and never dismisses on an outside click.
- **Multiline is a creation-time choice.** There is no setter, because `ES_MULTILINE` cannot be
  toggled on a live window.
- **Numeric mode is single-line only.** `CTextBox_SetNumericMode` returns without doing anything
  on a multiline control, and the getter still reads FALSE afterwards.
- **`EnterPressedCallback` is single-line only**, and the ENTER keypress is always swallowed
  there — no newline, no beep — whether or not a callback is installed.
- **ESCAPE is swallowed in both line modes**, because the editor would beep. Act on it, if you
  want to, from the message callback.
- **There is no horizontal scroll API.** A single-line control auto-scrolls horizontally on its
  own (`ES_AUTOHSCROLL`); a multiline control wraps instead, so there is nothing to scroll.
- **A multiline control never shows a native scrollbar.** No scrollbar styles are applied. Drive
  an external one through `ScrollChangedCallback` / `CTextBox_GetVScrollInfo` /
  `CTextBox_ScrollToLine`.
- **The control implements multiline wheel scrolling itself**, converting the delta to
  `EM_LINESCROLL` and honouring `SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES` (including `WHEEL_PAGESCROLL`, which
  scrolls a page per notch). The RichEdit's own wheel handling is bypassed entirely. Sub-notch
  deltas from a high-precision wheel or trackpad accumulate, so a slow swipe scrolls smoothly
  instead of doing nothing.
- **No mouse capture is taken.** The RichEdit manages its own selection-drag capture internally,
  which is why a message callback's return value is honoured uniformly — there is no invariant of
  the control's that a suppressed message could strand.
- **No per-character formatting.** One font and one forecolor for the whole buffer, guaranteed by
  `TM_PLAINTEXT`.
- **No vertical alignment setting.** A single-line control's text is always vertically centred; a
  multiline control's always starts at the top.
- **Alignment is measured between the margins, not between the border edges.** A centred value in
  a control with lopsided margins sits off-centre by design. Give it equal margins if you want it
  optically centred.
- **An unrecognized alignment value falls back to `TXT_ALIGN_LEFT`** rather than being rejected,
  so the control's alignment can never silently disagree with what the host thinks it set.
- **The right-click menu is rebuilt on every open**, from the current selection, clipboard and
  read-only state. When nothing qualifies — no selection, nothing to paste, no text — no menu
  appears at all.
- **Only one popup chain may be open per application.** A second textbox's menu closes the
  first's.

## API reference

### Creation

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_Create( hWndParent, CtrlID, bMultiline = false ) as HWND` | Creates the control as a child of `hWndParent` and returns its window handle. `CtrlID` becomes the container's `GWLP_ID`, so `GetDlgItem` finds it. `bMultiline` is fixed for the control's lifetime. Created zero-sized and hidden — place it with `SetWindowPos` including `SWP_SHOWWINDOW`. |
| `CTextBox_GetRichEditHandle( hTextBox ) as HWND` | The `RichEdit50W` child. For RichEdit-specific messages the flat API and the message door do not cover. |
| `CTextBox_GetMultiline( hTextBox ) as boolean` | TRUE for a multiline control. Set at creation, never changes. |
| `CTextBox_HasFocus( hTextBox ) as boolean` | TRUE when the editor owns the keyboard focus. **Use this** — focus lives on the child, so `GetFocus() = hTextBox` is always false. |

### Text and content

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetText( hTextBox ) as DWSTRING` | The whole buffer. |
| `CTextBox_SetText( hTextBox, Text ) as boolean` | Replaces the whole buffer. **Silent** — no change callback. Returns FALSE only when the handle is not a CTextBox. |
| `CTextBox_GetTextLength( hTextBox ) as integer` | Length in characters. |
| `CTextBox_GetSelText( hTextBox ) as DWSTRING` | The selected text, `""` when there is no selection. |
| `CTextBox_ReplaceSel( hTextBox, Text ) as boolean` | Replaces the selection, or inserts at the caret when there is none. **Silent**, but undoable. |
| `CTextBox_Clear( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Empties the buffer. **Silent** — it is `CTextBox_SetText( h, "" )`. |

### Selection

Positions are 0-based character indices.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetSel( hTextBox, byref nStart, byref nEnd )` | The selection range. `nStart = nEnd` means a caret with nothing selected. Both come back 0 when the handle is not a CTextBox. |
| `CTextBox_SetSel( hTextBox, nStart, nEnd )` | Sets the selection. `nEnd = -1` selects through the end of the text. |
| `CTextBox_SelectAll( hTextBox )` | Selects everything — `CTextBox_SetSel( h, 0, -1 )`. |

### Edit behaviour

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetLimitText( hTextBox ) as integer` | The current text-length limit, in characters. |
| `CTextBox_SetLimitText( hTextBox, nLimit )` | Sets the limit. 0 restores the default limit. |
| `CTextBox_GetReadOnly( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Read-only state, read from the editor's `ES_READONLY` style. |
| `CTextBox_SetReadOnly( hTextBox, bReadOnly ) as boolean` | Sets it; returns TRUE on success. A read-only control still allows selection, and its context menu still offers Copy and Select All. |
| `CTextBox_GetModify( hTextBox ) as boolean` | The editor's modified flag — set by user edits, cleared by a `WM_SETTEXT`. |
| `CTextBox_SetModify( hTextBox, bModified )` | Sets or clears that flag. |
| `CTextBox_SetPasswordChar( hTextBox, wchChar )` | The character displayed in place of each typed one. **0 turns password mode off.** Repaints the editor. |
| `CTextBox_GetSelectOnFocus( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Whether the control selects everything when it gains focus. Default FALSE. |
| `CTextBox_SetSelectOnFocus( hTextBox, bSelect )` | Turns that on. It applies to Tab and to a programmatic `SetFocus`; a **mouse click still places the caret at the click point**, because the click's own caret placement runs after the focus change and wins. |
| `CTextBox_GetMargins( hTextBox, byref nLeft, byref nRight )` | The stored left and right text margins, in pixels. |
| `CTextBox_SetMargins( hTextBox, nLeft, nRight )` | Sets them (`EM_SETMARGINS`) and repaints. Raw pixels — DPI-scale at the call site. They are stored, so they survive later font and geometry changes, which re-apply them. |

### Clipboard and undo

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_Cut( hTextBox )` | Cuts the selection to the clipboard. |
| `CTextBox_Copy( hTextBox )` | Copies the selection to the clipboard. |
| `CTextBox_Paste( hTextBox )` | Pastes. **In numeric mode the paste is vetted first** and rejected wholesale if the result would not be a valid number — nothing is ever half-pasted. |
| `CTextBox_CanPaste( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Whether the clipboard holds something the editor would accept. |
| `CTextBox_Undo( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Undoes the last edit; TRUE if something was undone. |
| `CTextBox_CanUndo( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Whether there is anything to undo. |

These six drive the editor exactly as Ctrl+X / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+Z would, so unlike the
text setters they are **not** silent — the change callback fires for them.

### Numeric mode

Single-line only. The accepted grammar is: an optional leading minus, digits, and at most one
decimal point followed by at most `DecimalPlaces` fractional digits. Typing is filtered character
by character against the text as it will be *after* the pending selection is replaced, and a
paste is validated as a whole. Control characters below 32 always pass, so backspace and the
Ctrl+C / V / X / Z / A shortcuts keep working.

On focus loss a non-empty value is reformatted to exactly `DecimalPlaces` (`"5."` becomes
`"5.00"`), silently, and before the focus callback runs — so a host reading the text there sees
the formatted value. An empty box stays empty, and the cue banner shows, unless `ZeroWhenEmpty`
is on.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetNumericMode( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Whether numeric filtering is on. Default FALSE. |
| `CTextBox_SetNumericMode( hTextBox, bEnable )` | Turns it on or off. **A no-op on a multiline control** — the getter still reads FALSE afterwards. Does not reformat whatever is already in the box. |
| `CTextBox_GetDecimalPlaces( hTextBox ) as integer` | The fractional-digit limit. Default 2. |
| `CTextBox_SetDecimalPlaces( hTextBox, nPlaces )` | Sets it; clamped to a minimum of 0, where **0 means integers only** and the decimal point is rejected outright. Does not reformat existing text. |
| `CTextBox_GetValue( hTextBox ) as double` | The text as a double. An empty box, `"-"` and `"."` all read as 0. |
| `CTextBox_SetValue( hTextBox, nValue ) as boolean` | Sets the text from a double, formatted to `DecimalPlaces` and **without thousands separators** (a comma is not an accepted input character). **Silent.** |
| `CTextBox_GetZeroWhenEmpty( hTextBox ) as boolean` | Whether an empty numeric box displays the formatted zero. Default FALSE. |
| `CTextBox_SetZeroWhenEmpty( hTextBox, bEnable )` | Turns it on. Stamps `"0.00"` immediately if the box is in numeric mode, currently empty **and not focused** — a focused box is left alone because the user may be mid-entry, and its next focus loss will stamp it. It trumps the cue banner, which effectively never shows again once the box has been visited. |

### Multiline and scrolling

Units are **lines**, shaped 1:1 for an external scrollbar: on each `ScrollChangedCallback` read
the three numbers and push them into the scrollbar's range, and wire the scrollbar's position
callback back to `CTextBox_ScrollToLine`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetVScrollInfo( hTextBox, byref nTotalLines, byref nLinesPerPage, byref nFirstVisibleLine )` | The whole vertical scroll state. `nLinesPerPage` is the formatting-rect height divided by the text font's line height (`tmHeight + tmExternalLeading`) — **a partial line at the bottom is not counted**. All three come back 0 when the control has no usable geometry yet, so call it after the control has been sized. A single-line control reports one total line and a first visible line of 0. |
| `CTextBox_ScrollToLine( hTextBox, nLine )` | Scrolls so `nLine` (0-based) becomes the first visible line. Negative values are clamped to 0, the editor clamps overscroll at the other end, and a request for the line already at the top does nothing. |

### Appearance

All fonts are caller-owned `HFONT`s — the control never deletes one.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_GetFont( hTextBox ) as HFONT` | The text font. 0 means the stock `DEFAULT_GUI_FONT` is in use. |
| `CTextBox_SetFont( hTextBox, hFont ) as boolean` | Sets it, rebuilds the character format for the whole buffer, redoes the single-line vertical centring, re-applies the margins and repaints. |
| `CTextBox_GetForeColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The text colour. |
| `CTextBox_SetForeColor( hTextBox, clr ) as COLORREF` | Sets it and re-applies the character format. **Returns the previous colour.** |
| `CTextBox_GetBackColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The editor's background colour. |
| `CTextBox_SetBackColor( hTextBox, clr ) as COLORREF` | Sets it (`EM_SETBKGNDCOLOR`) and repaints. **Returns the previous colour.** |
| `CTextBox_GetCueBannerText( hTextBox ) as DWSTRING` | The cue banner text; `""` means no banner. |
| `CTextBox_SetCueBannerText( hTextBox, Text )` | Sets it and repaints. Shown whenever the buffer is empty, focused or not. |
| `CTextBox_GetCueBannerColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The banner's colour. |
| `CTextBox_SetCueBannerColor( hTextBox, clr )` | Sets it and repaints. Independent of the text forecolor. |
| `CTextBox_GetCueBannerFont( hTextBox ) as HFONT` | The banner's font. 0 means it uses the text font. |
| `CTextBox_SetCueBannerFont( hTextBox, hFont )` | Sets it and repaints. Pass 0 to fall back to the text font. |
| `CTextBox_GetTextAlign( hTextBox ) as long` | `TXT_ALIGN_LEFT` (the default), `TXT_ALIGN_CENTER` or `TXT_ALIGN_RIGHT`. |
| `CTextBox_SetTextAlign( hTextBox, nAlign )` | Sets the horizontal alignment of the whole buffer, in both line modes, and it survives every later `SetText`. **Set it before the control has content.** Applying it rewrites the buffer — save, clear, switch to rich-text mode, apply, switch back, restore — because `TM_PLAINTEXT` refuses `EM_SETPARAFORMAT` silently, and that rewrite **discards the undo history**. Free on an empty control. Centring happens between the margins, not the border edges. An unrecognized value falls back to LEFT. |
| `CTextBox_GetBorderColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The frame colour used while the control does not have focus. |
| `CTextBox_SetBorderColor( hTextBox, clr )` | Sets it and repaints. |
| `CTextBox_GetFocusBorderColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The frame colour used while the editor has focus. |
| `CTextBox_SetFocusBorderColor( hTextBox, clr )` | Sets it and repaints. |
| `CTextBox_GetBorderWidth( hTextBox ) as integer` | The frame thickness in pixels. |
| `CTextBox_SetBorderWidth( hTextBox, nWidth )` | Sets it; clamped to a minimum of 0, where **0 means no border at all**. Repositions the editor, whose inset derives from this value. Raw pixels. |
| `CTextBox_GetCornerRadius( hTextBox ) as integer` | The corner radius in pixels. 0 means square corners. |
| `CTextBox_SetCornerRadius( hTextBox, nRadius )` | Sets it; clamped to a minimum of 0. The arcs are antialiased, so a large radius does not look stepped. Raw pixels. |
| `CTextBox_GetOuterBackColor( hTextBox ) as COLORREF` | The colour filling the pixels outside the corner arcs. |
| `CTextBox_SetOuterBackColor( hTextBox, clr )` | Sets it and repaints. Pass the host's background colour so rounded corners blend into the form. |
| `CTextBox_SetMenuText( hTextBox, CutText, CopyText, PasteText, SelectAllText = "" )` | Localizes the built-in context menu. An empty `SelectAllText` leaves the current Select All label alone. |

### Context menu and the message pump

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_FilterMessage( pMsg as MSG ptr ) as boolean` | **Mandatory** in the message pump. Returns TRUE when the open menu consumed the message, in which case do not translate or dispatch it. One call serves every CTextBox in the application, and costs one comparison when no menu is open. |
| `CTextBox_GetContextMenu( hTextBox ) as HWND` | The control's `CPopupMenu` window, created during `CTextBox_Create` and stable for the control's lifetime. Style it once at startup with the usual `CPopupMenu` setters (colours, fonts, glyphs, item height) and it will match the rest of your menus; left alone it renders with `CPopupMenu`'s own defaults. The **labels** are rebuilt on every open; colours and fonts are not. |
| `CTextBox_CloseContextMenu()` | Dismisses whichever CTextBox menu is open, anywhere in the application. **Silent** — no select callback fires. For a global "close every menu" moment: application deactivation, or a modal dialog about to open. Takes no handle. |

### Callback registration

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `CTextBox_SetChangeCallback( hTextBox, usersub )` | Told when the **user** changed the text. |
| `CTextBox_SetFocusCallback( hTextBox, usersub )` | Told when the editor gains or loses focus. |
| `CTextBox_SetEnterPressedCallback( hTextBox, usersub )` | Told when ENTER is pressed. Single-line only. |
| `CTextBox_SetMessageCallback( hTextBox, userfunc )` | Installs an observer, with veto, for key, mouse, focus and context-menu messages. |
| `CTextBox_SetScrollChangedCallback( hTextBox, usersub )` | Told when the vertical scroll state may have changed. Multiline only. |

All five are optional and independent.

## Colors

There is no colour struct. Each colour is its own property with its own getter and setter, and
each ships with a usable light-theme default, so a control you never colour still looks right.

| Property | Paints | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ForeColor` | All text in the buffer — one colour, no exceptions | `BGR(0,0,0)` |
| `BackColor` | The editor's background, inside the frame | `BGR(255,255,255)` |
| `CueColor` | The cue banner, while the buffer is empty | `BGR(128,128,128)` |
| `BorderColor` | The frame, while the control does not have focus | `BGR(122,122,122)` |
| `FocusBorderColor` | The frame, while the editor has focus | `BGR(0,120,215)` |
| `OuterBackColor` | The whole client area underneath the frame — visible only in the pixels outside the corner arcs | `BGR(255,255,255)` |

### Which colour wins

The frame takes exactly one colour per repaint:

```
editor has focus   ->   FocusBorderColor
otherwise          ->   BorderColor
```

There is no hot, pressed or disabled variant of any of these. The control does not track hover,
and disabling it is the host's business — `EnableWindow` on the container or on the editor —
which is why there is no disabled colour to configure.

The paint order is: `OuterBackColor` across the whole client, then the rounded frame filled with
`BackColor` and stroked in whichever border colour applies. Where the border width is 0 the frame
is filled and not stroked, and the editor covers the whole client anyway.

`CueColor` is independent of `ForeColor` on purpose: a cue banner that is simply the text colour
reads as content rather than as a hint.

## Callbacks

### Change

```freebasic
type TXT_ChangeCallbackSub as sub( byval hTextBox as HWND )
```

The text changed because of **user** interaction — typing, cut, paste, undo. Read the new text
with `CTextBox_GetText`.

It never fires for `CTextBox_SetText`, `CTextBox_ReplaceSel`, `CTextBox_Clear`,
`CTextBox_SetValue`, a `WM_SETTEXT` or `EM_REPLACESEL` sent through the message door, the numeric
reformat on focus loss, or the buffer rewrite `CTextBox_SetTextAlign` performs. That is what
makes it safe to call a setter from inside this handler.

### Focus

```freebasic
type TXT_FocusCallbackSub as sub( byval hTextBox as HWND, byval bGotFocus as boolean )
```

The editor gained (`bGotFocus = true`) or lost (`false`) the keyboard focus. In numeric mode the
value has **already** been reformatted by the time you are called on a focus loss, so the text
you read here is the formatted one. The control has also already invalidated itself for the
border-colour switch.

### Enter pressed

```freebasic
type TXT_EnterPressedCallbackSub as sub( byval hTextBox as HWND )
```

The user pressed ENTER. **Single-line only** — in a multiline control ENTER inserts a newline and
this never fires.

The keypress itself is always swallowed, whether or not a callback is installed: no newline is
inserted and the editor does not beep.

### Scroll changed

```freebasic
type TXT_ScrollChangedCallbackSub as sub( byval hTextBox as HWND )
```

The vertical scroll state **may** have changed. Multiline only. It is relayed from the editor's
`EN_UPDATE`, which fires on any display update — typing, a programmatic `SetText`, scrolling by
wheel, key or caret movement — and the control's wheel handler calls it directly as well.

Deliberately **not** gated the way the change callback is: a programmatic `SetText` changes the
line count, and a scrollbar has to hear about that. Treat it as "re-read the numbers", not as
"the user scrolled":

```freebasic
sub TextBox_ScrollChangedCallback( byval hTextBox as HWND )
    dim as integer nTotal, nPage, nFirst
    CTextBox_GetVScrollInfo( hTextBox, nTotal, nPage, nFirst )
    CVScrollBar_SetRange( ghScrollBar, nTotal, nPage, nFirst )
end sub
```

### Message

```freebasic
type TXT_MessageCallbackFunc as function( byval m as CTEXTBOX_MESSAGEINFO ptr ) as boolean
```

Observes messages arriving at the editor **before** the control acts on them. Return TRUE to
suppress both the control's handling and the editor's own; FALSE to let it proceed.

`CTEXTBOX_MESSAGEINFO`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hTextBox` | The **control** (container) handle, not the RichEdit child |
| `uMsg` | The message |
| `wParam` | Its first parameter |
| `lParam` | Its second parameter |

Only these messages are reported:

`WM_KEYDOWN`, `WM_KEYUP`, `WM_CHAR`, `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`, `WM_LBUTTONUP`, `WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK`,
`WM_RBUTTONDOWN`, `WM_RBUTTONUP`, `WM_MBUTTONDOWN`, `WM_MBUTTONUP`, `WM_MOUSEMOVE`,
`WM_MOUSEWHEEL`, `WM_CONTEXTMENU`, `WM_SETFOCUS`, `WM_KILLFOCUS`.

**The return value is honoured uniformly** — there is no message whose suppression is quietly
ignored. That is a direct consequence of the control taking no mouse capture: the RichEdit
manages its own selection-drag capture internally, so there is no state of the control's that a
suppressed message could strand.

Two vetoes worth knowing about:

| Veto | Effect |
|---|---|
| `WM_KEYDOWN` with `VK_TAB` | Repurposes Tab. A single-line control otherwise consumes it to move focus to the next or previous tabstop, so vetoing it is how you drive something else with Tab — a picker list, for instance. |
| `WM_SETFOCUS` / `WM_KILLFOCUS` | Also suppresses the editor's own caret handling. Only do this on purpose. |

A worked example — ESC clears the box:

```freebasic
function TextBox_MessageCallback( byval m as CTEXTBOX_MESSAGEINFO ptr ) as boolean
    if (m->uMsg = WM_KEYDOWN) andalso (m->wParam = VK_ESCAPE) then
        CTextBox_Clear( m->hTextBox )     ' programmatic, so no change callback
        return true
    end if
    return false
end function
```

---

## Constants

```freebasic
enum
    TXT_ALIGN_LEFT = 0      ' the default
    TXT_ALIGN_CENTER
    TXT_ALIGN_RIGHT
end enum
```

These are the control's own constants rather than richedit's `PFA_*` values: how alignment
reaches the editor is an implementation detail, the same way you do not have to know that the
forecolor arrives by `EM_SETCHARFORMAT`.

There are no `#define`d default constants — the defaults live on the control's own type:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Multiline | `false` |
| Border width | 1 px |
| Corner radius | 0 (square corners) |
| Left / right margin | 0 / 0 px |
| Text alignment | `TXT_ALIGN_LEFT` |
| Select on focus | `false` |
| Numeric mode | `false` |
| Decimal places | 2 |
| Zero when empty | `false` |
| Text font | 0 — the stock `DEFAULT_GUI_FONT` |
| Cue banner font | 0 — falls back to the text font |
| Cue banner text | `""` — no banner |
| Context menu labels | `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste`, `Select All` |

Colour defaults are listed under **Colors**.

## Related controls

**CPopupMenu** is not optional — it *is* the built-in right-click menu, and both its files must
be in your project and included before `CTextBox.inc`. Reach the control's instance with
`CTextBox_GetContextMenu` and style it with `CPopupMenu`'s own setters; that handle is stable for
the control's lifetime, so theming it once at startup is enough. `CTextBox_FilterMessage` exists
because `CPopupMenu` is not modal, and it simply routes the message on to `CPopupMenu`'s filter.

**CBufferPaint** is the drawing surface the frame is painted through, and the reason for the
GDI+ bracket and the `ok` identifier rule in **Requirements**.

**CVScrollBar** is what a multiline control's scroll API is shaped for: `ScrollChangedCallback`
fires, you read `CTextBox_GetVScrollInfo` and push the three numbers into
`CVScrollBar_SetRange( total, page, pos )`, and the scrollbar's own position callback goes
straight into `CTextBox_ScrollToLine`. Nothing about CTextBox requires it — any external
scrollbar that speaks in lines will do — but the units were chosen to make that wiring a
one-liner in each direction.
